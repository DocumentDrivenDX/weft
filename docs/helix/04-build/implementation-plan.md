# Build plan

## Scope

Implement the Weft compiler governed by the PRD, CONTRACT-001 through CONTRACT-004, TD-001 through TD-006 and TP-001. The bootstrap delivered specifications and fixture validation. B-001 now passes its bounded embedding gate; ADR-001 selects Rust for the foundation. The spike is not the public compiler; ADR-002 now accepts the structural backend boundary; public contracts remain draft specifications with scoped executable evidence. No production storage compatibility is claimed.

## Shared Constraints

Input is Weft SQL plus explicitly supplied pinned UMF modules; output is target SQL with parameters, types, decoding, obligations, versions and diagnostics. One registered backend per query. Initial targets are Truss/PostgreSQL and Ashlar/Databricks. No database IO in the compiler core, implicit model fetching, native SQL passthrough or silent meaning loss.

## Implementation Slices

| Slice | Story / area | Depends on | Validation gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-001 | SPIKE-001 native Python/browser | None | Pin toolchain; actual extension and browser compile/refusal parity; decide ADR-001 |
| B-002 | US-001 model resolution, parser, typed IR | B-001 | Independent oracle, corpus semantic/refusal tests; finalize versioned Rust IR representation |
| B-002A | US-007 versioned application-read frontend | B-002 | CONTRACT-004, independent member/presence/order/count/relationship/parameter fixtures |
| B-003 | US-002 registry, binding validation, capabilities | B-002A | Third synthetic plugin; exact typed trait and manifest contract; finalize ADR-002 |
| B-004 | US-005 compile envelope and embeddings | B-003 | Original and application-read requests across Rust/Python/browser; precise UTF-8 spans and deterministic diagnostics |
| B-005 | US-003 Truss adapter | B-003, documented UMF storage realization and mapping (pinned drafts permitted) | Native PostgreSQL exact results, storage boundaries and emitted host obligations |
| B-006 | US-004 Ashlar adapter | B-003, accepted Ashlar layout/binding | Native Databricks exact results, numeric/collation/publication boundaries |
| B-007 | US-006 qualification and release matrix | B-004–006 | All 30 ACs, expanded corpus, property/fuzz/mutation gates and versioned evidence |

## Issue Decomposition

No tracker items are created by this bootstrap. The slices are ready for work-item creation with references to the corresponding US, TD, STP and this plan. Use dependency links above; keep each issue scoped to a failing acceptance test and its implementation. Backend-owner mapping decisions block production qualification; owner-authorized candidate adapter development and fixtures proceed against exact versioned drafts.

## Validation Plan

- Write failing behavioral tests from independently specified cases before implementation.
- Preserve fixture expectations; resolve disagreements through contract review, never by copying emitted SQL into expected results.
- Require relevant checks and actual evidence before closing a slice.
- Update canonical specifications when behavior changes; keep unsupported operations explicit.

## Risks and Rollbacks

Rust packaging/toolchain feasibility has bounded B-001 evidence on one platform; broader wheel/browser matrices remain unqualified. Missing backend layouts block claims, not frontend progress. Keep adapters separately registered so an unsupported profile can be disabled without changing logical semantics. Version incompatible changes; preserve prior corpus and evidence.

## Exit Criteria

All 30 P0 story criteria pass; both initial adapters have qualified native profiles; native Python and real browser embedding pass; support inventory names exact versions and domains; no candidate-only claim is advertised as supported. Release procedures, package ownership and license are decided before distribution.

## Execution status

B-001: complete for its bounded scope; [evidence](evidence/B-001-native-python-browser.md). B-002: complete for the 0.1 frontend; [evidence](evidence/B-002-frontend.md). B-002A: complete for its versioned application frontend scope; [evidence](evidence/B-002A-application-reads.md). B-003: complete for the registered library boundary; [evidence](evidence/B-003-backend-interface.md). B-004: complete for the public envelope and native Python/browser component scope; [evidence](evidence/B-004-compile-embeddings.md). B-005: complete for its owner-authorized candidate compiler scope. [Acceptance audit](evidence/B-005-acceptance.md) maps US-003-AC1–AC4 to original model/binding admission, independent native PostgreSQL results and actual host transport/publication checks. The original sales query passes all 16 row/props home cuts; numeric comparison prerequisites reject hidden out-of-domain values. Recursive/presence, complete entity, count, relationship and composite paging evidence is retained in the [execution record](evidence/B-005-native-preparation.md). The sales driver passes 224 actual psycopg cases, including 192 execution/publication refusals. The latest implementation checkpoint passes 160 Rust regressions and fresh Python/Chromium parity. Capabilities stay candidate; native null is unsupported by the selected profile. Truss runtime adoption and installed-production qualification are separate. No production or released package claim is made. B-006: complete for its owner-authorized candidate compiler scope. The [acceptance audit](evidence/B-006-acceptance.md) maps US-004-AC1–AC4 to native Databricks exact results, explicit props/typed homes, relationship and recursive/presence boundaries, and actual buffered host transport/custody checks. The final Ashlar package passes 18 Rust tests; the workspace checkpoint passes 182. Compound values pass 133 native cases, six name/resource controls and 48 entity/keyset combinations; the native host driver passes 30 cases plus 49 independent host controls. Fresh Python/Chromium/CLI builds match 463 artifacts with an explicitly recorded declaration-only correction. Capabilities remain candidate; no production policy, storage adoption or package release is qualified. B-007: not started. Story acceptance allocations remain planned; B-001 does not close US-005 or any release conformance gate.

## PR #2 scope update

B-002 establishes the unchanged 0.1 frontend. The next separately reviewed slice B-002A adds the owner-requested application-read extension before backend contracts are finalized. B-003 through B-007 must include its typed representations, capabilities, host obligations and native tests. A production backend cannot advertise complete entity/relationship/paging support without corresponding binding evidence.

## Compiler/storage ownership correction (2026-10-07)

The user clarified that UMF owns logical and physical schema meaning, Truss supplies its storage realization and mapping, and Weft owns query lowering, target SQL and result decoding. Truss runtime implementation, public decoder adoption, authorization procedures and installed-production qualification are not prerequisites for compiler implementation or completion of the compiler slice. Hosts execute SQL and enforce the emitted obligations. B-005 uses exact pinned draft storage descriptions plus independent PostgreSQL fixtures; production compatibility remains separately qualified. This supersedes earlier runtime/adoption blocking interpretations without weakening exact type, presence, storage-home or unknown-meaning refusal requirements. Full recursive and scalar query coverage, public backend integration and actual native/compiler evidence remain required B-005 work. The goal resumes in B-005; B-006 follows its merge.
